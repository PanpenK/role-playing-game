# Role Playing Game

## Overview

This text-based role-playing game (RPG) challenges players to defeat a ferocious dragon that's terrorizing a town. It was developed as a practice project to learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Key Features

Interactive gameplay: Players navigate through different locations, battle monsters, manage health and gold, purchase weapons, and make strategic decisions.
Inventory system: Players can acquire and manage various weapons with different power levels.
Combat mechanics: Engaging turn-based combat system with player attacks, monster attacks, dodging, and health management.
Resource management: Players must strategically balance their health, gold, and experience points to progress.
Progression system: Players gain experience and gold through battles, allowing them to purchase better weapons and become stronger.
Win and lose conditions: Players can either defeat the dragon to win or succumb to monster attacks and lose the game.
Easter egg: A hidden mini-game adds an extra layer of challenge and fun.

## Technologies Used

HTML: Structure and content of the game pages.
CSS: Visual styling and layout of the game elements.
JavaScript: Handling player interactions, game logic, and dynamic updates.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

JavaScript fundamentals: Variables, data types, functions, conditional statements, arrays, objects.
DOM manipulation: Interacted with HTML elements using JavaScript to update game content dynamically.
Event handling: Captured user input (buttons, clicks) and triggered appropriate actions in the game.
Game development concepts: Applied programming concepts to create a simple but engaging game experience.
Project structure: Organized code into files and functions for better readability and maintainability.
